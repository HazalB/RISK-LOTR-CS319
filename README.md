##**Project Description**
RISK: LOTR is our CS319 Group Project. It is based on the original RISK Table Game but it is set on Tolkien's Lord of The Rings Universe, and in particularly Middle Earth. The game will be a desktop application and it will be a multiplayer game. Each player will take turns on the same computer, making their moves.

The game will play on a map of the Middle Earth and it will be divided into regions. Each player will choose a kingdom correspoding to the regions of the map. According to the regions one controls, she will be able to deploy soldiers at the beginning of her turn. If you have at least one soldier in a region, you can attack adjacent regions with all or some of these soldiers. The battle will be resolved acocording to the number of soldiers each side has. The side of the defending area will always use all of the soldiers stationed in that area and the attacking side will only use the soldiers allocated to this particular attack. Each side will roll different number of dice proportional to the number of soldier it has in the battle and the side which has the greater sum of the result of the dice will win. If the attacking side wins, she will gain this region otherwise the region will remain unchanged. The goal of each player is to control all of the map in which case she will win the game. In order to do this, she would want to gain control of areas, which are composed of certain regions because areas would give her extra troops to deploy at the start of her turn. One example of an area would be "Mordor."

Depending on the progress of the project, we may add some exciting features such as the following:
  * Having different types of soldiers which will have different capabilities in battle. e.g. Nazgul will be better against infantry.
  * Adding new GUI elements such as rolling of the dice, portrait of the kings or different visual characteristics for soldiers.
  * Battle animations.
  * Soundtracks and sound effects.
